            <div id="me">
                I am John Mikhail, a computer science graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, class of 2016 minoring in Robotics.
            I love Robotics and trying to learn the most from one of the best Robotics institutes in the world, the RI in CMU.
            I have worked with Hala (a bi-lingual roboceptionist in Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar) in my first two years in the university,
            details about my work can be found in my Resume. I am also interested in HCI (Human-Computer interaction) and trying to find ways to
            improve the ways we can interact with computers. I am also interested in Psychology and knowing how people interact which I believe can help us improve HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) and build better robots. <br>
            I became interested in Webapp development after taking Webapp course and built some cool projects.

        					Hala is a robot-receptionist that is in Carnegie Mellon University-Qatar campus. The idea of this project was based on Hala hence the name. This project was a team project for Perceptual Computing course. We had an animated face and we implemented some facial expressions. We used Intel SDK with the Creative camera for voice commands and face detection. The robot answers some specific questions asked using the voice commands and reply using voice synthesis. The robot also responds to some of the interlocutor's facial expressions like smiling and nodding, by smiling back and nodding back trying to enhance the Human-Robot interaction and make it more human friendly.

        					This project was for Introduction to Text-Processing course. The sentiment analyzer is trained with thousands of tweets that are positive, neutral or negative. Then, using naive Bayes method and lib-SVM, it predicts if the other tweets (different than the ones used in training) are positive, neutral or negative. To implement that we had to use different features. My analyzer used different features like checking for positive or negative words in the tweet. It also check for emoticons (":)", ":D", ":(", ":S"...etc), and for all caps words. One other feature that I thought is essential is "not" being before a positive or a negative word because that will change the positivity or negativity of the tweet.

Flex sensors attached to the glove were used to detect the bending of the fingers and then data was analyzed on the board and signal was sent using Xbee to the robot car. The car will then move based on the signal it received, either forward, backward, left or right. If no fingers were bent a stop signal is sent and the car stops.

The data from the database was then used to plot different graphs in an online dashboard, where you can specify range of date and graphs will be plotted showing comparisons of data in this period of time. I used Django and django chartit as frameworks for building the dashboard and plotting the graphs.
